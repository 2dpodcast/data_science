Should we Build or Buy/Use a lib/package/algo?
---

Yes and No.

Buy for existing ones: it's trustworthy, well testing and documented. If you're practitioner, you don't need to reinvent the wheels.
Build for learning experience: it's icing on cake. You will achieve higher level of understanding the algo and go to customize and expend as more functions as you want.
