Why performance is not satisfactory?
---

- data is skewed
- lot of noises
- many outliers
- lack of info features
- time to train

In brief, high variance (overfitting) vs high bias (underfitting). How can we know it? Simply show it with learning curve:

- x: train size
- y: scoring

What is validation curve?

In case we need to tune C of SVM, it is able to draw validation curve.

- x: different Cs
- y: scores
