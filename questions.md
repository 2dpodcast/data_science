Questions in DS

> One way to learn is doing and asking. The more iteration you have the better understanding we get.

Given data, what would you come to do?

1. Describe the data: EDA, summarize, simplify, distill, condense data to understand

- How is data organized? Clustering
- What does it look like? 
- Which topic of words? Dimension Reduction (DR)
- Is this weird? Anomaly Detection

For example, we can use GDP to rank the country for development status. Just 1 metric to represent all the aspects of the country might not be fair enough, but it is a typical way to have in daily conversation.


2. Is this A|B? A|B|C|D --> classification problems such as spam filtering, sentiment analysis, sarcarsm detection, news categorized, etc.


3. How much | many items will we sell next week? --> regression problems

Questions can be transformed and modified to various viewpoint of classification or regression. For instance, instead of classifying Yes/No customer gonna leave our service, we can estimate likelihood of probability churn rate.

4. What should I do now? this is Reinforcement Learning family (RL)
